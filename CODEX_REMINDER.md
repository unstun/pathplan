Codex working notes
===================

- Project scope: thesis-writing project on global path planning in dense forest scenes.
- Maintain academic rigor: clarity, citations (when applicable), reproducibility, and concise explanations.
- Prioritize path planning algorithms, post-processing/smoothing, and evaluation outputs; avoid unrelated feature creep.
- Preserve existing experimental outputs; never discard user data or revert user changes.
- Keep responses concise, factual, and tuned to research/reporting needs.
